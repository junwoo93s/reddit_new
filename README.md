# reddit_new
I used electron and angular to build an application for grabing the latest post of the subreddit.
user must enter the valid url of the subreddit and it will give you the title and text of the lastest post.

new features:
1. I opened a new window, if the latest post's text field is just url or picture.

challenges: 
1. coding itself was not that hard, but downloading and using the dependencies of these platforms was tricky.
2. If I can get to use python (clearly, it didn't work) it must have been easier. 

Overall it was a fun project.
